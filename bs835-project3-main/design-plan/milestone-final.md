# Project 3, Final Submission: Design Journey

[← Table of Contents](design-journey.md)


> **Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)
>
> Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.
>
> Place all design journey images inside the "design-plan" folder and then link them in Markdown so that they are visible in Markdown Preview.
>
> **Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.


## Milestone 1 Feedback Revisions
> Explain what you revised in response to the Milestone 1 feedback (1-2 sentences)
> If you didn't make any revisions, explain why.

I added attributes to my < button > in the HTML

## Interactivity Usability Justification
> Explain how the interactivity _functionally_ improves the user's experience and helps them accomplish their goals. (i.e. Your interactivity does _more_ than add additional clicks; the interactivity doesn't insert additional barriers for the user when working towards their goals.)
> Explain how your interactivity's design effectively uses affordances, visibility, feedback, and familiarity.
> Write a paragraph (3-4 sentences)

My interactivity improves the user's experience because it helps them a) navigate my website easier and b) gather more information about my goals (why they visited my website in the first place).

First, my interactivity helps make navigating my website easier because of the hamburger menu for narrow screens. This hamburger menu creates a familiar format where the button name is the name of the page the user is actively on and when users click or hover on the button, there is a visibility of the border getting thicker to show it is being interacted with. This similar style, thickened border and the location of the bottom at the top right corner are all affordances for the user to navigate the button's use. The button's border getting thicker when opening the hamburger menu and the dropdown menu items showing the other pages to click on are a part of the feedback.

Second, the modal on my contact page helps enhance the user's goal when visiting my website because I want people to get to know me more and reach out to me. The pop-up on the page tells the user that I am looking for opportunities and I am open to chat. Then, there is a button that says "Yay!" that holds the same property as my hamburger menu button where the border thickens when hovered or clicked on. And therefore, the same design principles apply but for the feedback, the background unblurs as the modal closes for the user to see the actual content.

## Tell Us What to Grade
> We aren't re-grading your entire Project 1 or 2.
> We are only grading the interactivity you added to the project.
> Tell us where (what pages) we can find your interactivity and how to use it.
> **We will only grade what you list here;** if it's not listed here, we won't grade it. **No exceptions.**

Hamburger menu: I made the navigation menu on all three pages of my website hamburger menus. This is for narrow screens only so adjust your screen a bit! The button is on the top right corner of each page and the text on the button is the name of the page you are currently on (if you are on Experiences page, then it should say "Experiences"). Hovering your cursor on the button will make the border a little thicker to show interactivity.  And your mouse cursor will be a pointer to see it is clickable. Clicking on the button will open the other two pages you CAN navigate to (note: the current page you are on is not an option). Clicking the button again will close the menu. Clicking on the two links will lead you to their respective pages.

Modal: This is on the "Contact Me" or contact.html page. The modal should appear as soon as you navigate to the page. It will tell the user I am looking for opportunities and for user's to contact me! Click the "Yay!" button to close the modal and use the page as normal. When you hover on the "Yay!" button, the border will thicken to show interactivity. And your mouse cursor will be a pointer to see it is clickable.

## Self-Reflection
> Reflect on what you learned during this assignment. How have you improved from Project 1? What would you do differently next time? (2-3 sentences)

I learned how to implement JS interactive elements using Interactivity JavaScript Snippets. I was able to add a hamburger dropdown menu and a pop-up modal. I improved from project 1 as I am not only just able to create a website using HTML, I know how to design it with CSS and make interactional components too.

> Take some time here to reflect on how much you've learned since you started this class. It's often easy to ignore our own progress. Take a moment and think about your accomplishments in this class. Hopefully you'll recognize that you've accomplished a lot and that you should be very proud of those accomplishments! (1-3 sentences)

I truly learned a lot in this class, especially coming in knowing nothing about making websites. It is so interesting how HTML, CSS, and JS come together to make a functional website. The class really broke it down into digestable components to learn every bit and piece everything together. I am really glad I was able to develop these skills through building a personal website.
